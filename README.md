# Space Shooter
First game (attempt) in c++. The code is one hell of a mess.If you really need to build the project you'll have to download and install the dependencies and probably rewrite CMakeLists.txt (you can use the existing one as a cheat sheet).

# Dependencies
- SFML 2.3.2
- tinyxml2
- entityx
- Box2D
